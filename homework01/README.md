Reader Files on Meteorite Landings Data 

These files read meteorite landings data provided by NASA. They output a set of summary statistics, including (in order), the average mass of the meteorites (for that data set), the hemisphere in which the meteorites landed, and the amount (in %) each hemisphere shows up.

This program accepts the file name as an argument in the commandline. 
To run these scripts, input into the commandline "python3 ml_(type of file)_reader.py (dataset file name)"
